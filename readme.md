WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING ?
```
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases.
Cloud computing has 3 stages:
(1)-Cloud computing is storing data or applications on remote servers.
(2)-Processing data or application from servers.
(3)-Accessing data or application through internet any where of the world.
