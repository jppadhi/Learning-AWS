* CLOUD COMPUTING:-
```
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases.
Cloud computing has 3 stages:
(1)-Cloud computing is storing data or applications on remote servers.
(2)-Processing data or application from servers.
(3)-Accessing data or application through internet any where of the world.
```
Services model:-
```
There are three services models
(1)-Iaas:-Infrastructure as a service is one of Amazon Web Services that focuses on providing infrastructure services based on cloud computing technology.IaaS Amazon Service is used to replace physical resources, such as servers, with virtual resources hosted and managed by Amazon.
(2)-Paas:-
```
Deployment models:-

There are three types:

```
* Public cloud: 
Here, the resources and services provided by third-party service providers are available to customers via the Internet.
* Private cloud: 
In a private cloud, the resources and services are managed in-house or by third parties, exclusively for a particular organization.
* Hybrid cloud: 
It is a combination of both public and private cloud types. The decision whether to run the services on public or private depends on some parameters such as the sensitivity of the data and applications, industry certifications and required standards, etc.

AWS
```
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of various Cloud Computing services and applications that offers flexible, reliable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective solutions.
```
Instance: 
```
An instance is a virtual server for running applications on AWS.
```
Types of AWS Services:-
```
Auto-scaling: It is a service designed by EC2, which is used to launch or terminate EC2 instances based on user-defined policies.

Elastic Load Balancing: It automatically distributes the incoming application traffic across multiple instances at multiple availability zones.
```
Networking Services:-
```
VPC: 
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual data center in AWS consisting of a set of isolated resources.
Direct Connect: 
It is used to establish a dedicated network connection from the host network to AWS without an Internet connection.
Route 53: 
It is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) and domain name registration service, and 53 is the port on which this service runs.
Computing Services:-
EC2: 
It is a virtual server that provides resizable compute capacity on the cloud.
Elastic Beanstalk: 
It is an application container used for deploying and managing containers. It creates an environment for working with web applications.
Lambda: 
It is a computing service that runs the code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources.
EC2 Container Service: 
It allows us to easily run and manage Docker containers across a cluster of EC2 instances.
```
Storage Services:-
```
S3: 
It refers to Simple Storage Service and allows the storage of data objects of any sort and flat files in the cloud. It is secure, scalable, and durable.
CloudFront: 
It defines a Content Delivery Network. It provides a way to distribute content to end-users with low-latency and high data-transfer speeds.
Glacier: 
It is a low-cost storage service that provides secure and durable storage for long-term data archiving and backup.
EFS (Elastic File Storage): 
It is a file storage service used in EC2 instances and connects to multiple EC2 instances.
Snowball: 
It is used for moving large amounts of data into/out of AWS using secure appliances, i.e., it provides the data archiving functionality for the data that no longer needs to be accessed actively.
Storage Gateway: 
It is used for securely integrating on-premises IT environments with cloud storage for backup and disaster recovery.
RDS (Relational Database Service): 
It allows the storage of data objects as part of the relational database. It makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale familiar relational databases in the cloud.
DynamoDB: 
It is a scalable NoSQL data store that is used to manage distributed replicas of data for high availability.
ElastiCache: 
It improves application performance by allowing us to retrieve information from an in-memory caching system. It is a way of caching databases in the cloud.
Redshift: 
It is a fast, fully managed data warehousing service, which makes it cost-effective to analyze all data using the existing Business Intelligence tools.
DMS (Data Migration Service): 
It helps in migrating databases to the cloud easily and securely. It can also be used for converting databases.
