# `CLOUD COMPUTING:-`
```
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases.
Cloud computing has 3 stages:
(1)-Cloud computing is storing data or applications on remote servers.
(2)-Processing data or application from servers.
(3)-Accessing data or application through internet any where of the world.
```
* `Services model:-`
```
There are three services models
(1)-Iaas:-(Infrastructure as a service) 
The cloud service provider,provides you the hardware resources like servers,Database,processors,RAM,vertual hosting etc. through cloud this is called IAAS.
EX-AWS,Microsoft Azure.
(2)-Paas:-(Platform as a services)
Cloud provides you the platform where you can code,create applications and also deploy application,this type of service is called PAAS.
EX-Google app engines,IBM Bluemix.
(3)-Saas(Software as a services):-
Cloud provides you the softwares,where you can use them from anywhere.This is called SAAS.
Ex-Gmail,Google Drive

```
* `Deployment models:-`

There are three types:
* `Public cloud:`
The resources and services provided by third-party service providers are available to customers via the Internet.
* `Private cloud:`
In a private cloud, the resources and services are managed in-house or by third parties for a particular organization.
* `Hybrid cloud:`
It is a combination of both public and private cloud types. The decision whether to run the services on public or private depends on some parameters such as the sensitivity of the data and applications, industry certifications and required standards, etc.
# AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of various Cloud Computing services and applications that offers flexible, reliable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective solutions.
* `Instance:-`
An instance is a virtual server for running applications on AWS.

Types of AWS Services:-
* `Auto-scaling:` 
It is a service designed by EC2, which is used to launch or terminate EC2 instances based on user-defined policies.

* `Elastic Load Balancing:` 
Elastic load balancing is a load balancing service by AWS,which distributes incoming traffic across several targets,such as amazon EC2 instances,lambda functions,containers and ranges of IP addresses,in multiple availability zones.

# Computing Services:-
* `EC2:-` 
Elastic compute cloud is a part of Amazon cloud-computing platform. AWS, that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer application.
* `Lightsail:-`
It is an easy-to-use virtual private server (VPS) that offers you everything needed to build an application or website, plus a cost-effective, monthly plan. Whether you're new to the cloud or looking to get on the cloud quickly with AWS infrastructure you trust, we've got you covered.
* `Lambda:-`
It is a computing service that runs the code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources.
* `Batch:-` 
It is a set of batch management capabilities that enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily and efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS.
* `Elastic Beanstalk:-`
It is an application container used for deploying and managing containers. It creates an environment for working with web applications.
# Comtainers:-
* `EC2 Container Service:-`
It allows us to easily run and manage Docker containers across a cluster of EC2 instances.
# Storage Services:-
* `S3:`
It refers to Simple Storage Service and allows the storage of data objects of any sort and flat files in the cloud. It is secure, scalable, and durable.
* `EFS (Elastic File Storage):-`
It is a file storage service used in EC2 instances and connects to multiple EC2 instances.
* `FSx:`

* `S3 Glacier:`
It is a low-cost storage service that provides secure and durable storage for long-term data archiving and backup.

* `Storage Gateway:`
It is used for securely integrating on-premises IT environments with cloud storage for backup and disaster recovery.
# Database:-
* `RDS (Relational Database Service):`
It allows the storage of data objects as part of the relational database. It makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale familiar relational databases in the cloud.
* `DynamoDB:`
It is a scalable NoSQL data store that is used to manage distributed replicas of data for high availability.
* `ElastiCache:`
It improves application performance by allowing us to retrieve information from an in-memory caching system. It is a way of caching databases in the cloud.
* `Redshift:`
It is a fast, fully managed data warehousing service, which makes it cost-effective to analyze all data using the existing Business Intelligence tools.
* `DMS (Data Migration Service):` 
It helps in migrating databases to the cloud easily and securely. It can also be used for converting databases.
# Networking Services:-
* `VPC:`
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual data center in AWS consisting of a set of isolated resources.
* `Direct Connect:`
It is used to establish a dedicated network connection from the host network to AWS without an Internet connection.
* `Route 53:`
It is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) and domain name registration service, and 53 is the port on which this service runs.
# Analytics:-
* `EMR:`
Amazon Elastic MapReduce helps in performing big data tasks such as web indexing, data mining, and log file analysis.
* `Data Pipeline:`
It helps in moving data from one service to another. It is a service used for periodic, data-driven workflows.
* `AWS Elasticsearch:`
It is a managed service that helps in deploying, operating, and scaling Elasticsearch.
* `Kinesis:`
It makes it easy to work with real-time streaming data in the AWS cloud.
* `AWS Machine Learning:`
It is a service that enables us to easily build smart applications.
* `AWS QuickSight:`
It is a cloud-assisted Business Intelligence service that helps in deriving insights from data easily.
# Security and Identity:-
* `IAM:`
It helps in configuring security for all the services. It is used to ensure that our other services remain safe and inaccessible to others.
* `Directory Service:`
It is used to provide a managed directory in the cloud.
Inspector: It enables us to analyze the behavior of the applications we run on AWS and helps in identifying potential security issues.
* `WAF (Web Application Firewall):`
It protects our web application from attacks by providing web traffic filters.
* `Cloud HSM:`
It is a Hardware Security Module.
* `KMS:`
